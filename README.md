# Electrical Engineering Project Portfolio  

This repository highlights selected hands-on projects I have built as part of my coursework and independent exploration in **electrical engineering, embedded systems, and hardware design**. Each project folder contains a more detailed README with design notes, code explanations, and implementation details.  

## Projects  

### 1. Useless Box with Personality  
A playful mechanical/electrical project that uses **PWM motor control** and **limit switches** to create a box that “fights back” when interacted with.  
- **Core idea:** A switch on the outside of the box is flipped on; the box opens, and a mechanical arm flips the switch off.  
- **Unique feature:** The box is programmed with distinct “personalities,” such as rushing forward to flip the switch quickly and then slowly retreating.  
- **Skills demonstrated:**  
  - PWM for motor speed control  
  - Mechanical switch debouncing and control logic  
  - Integration of hardware + software for interactive design

### 2. LED Matrix Audio Visualizer  
An embedded systems project that processes real-time microphone input and displays sound levels on an LED matrix.  
- **Core idea:** Microphone signals are filtered and mapped to visual bar patterns on the matrix.  
- **Hardware used:** ESP32 microcontroller, shift registers, microphone input module, LED matrix.  
- **Skills demonstrated:**  
  - Signal sampling and filtering  
  - Driving LED matrices with shift registers  
  - Embedded C++ programming on ESP32

### About This Portfolio  
This repository is intended to showcase hands-on engineering work I've completed outside of the classroom.
